## _Team 10841 Autonomous explanation_

   Our autonomous will start out with the robot _**centered**_ on the tile separation line (on the
first line from the corner vortex as we can be).
##                                       _**Blue**_
   For our blue autonomous, we start out by moving
away form the wall and turning to face the white line leading to the first beacon. Then it moves
forward until it is inline with the Center Vortex, it will then fire two particles in
to it. Than it will travel onto the beacon. Once at the beacon, it will sense the correct button
and press it.
##                                        _**Red**_
   The red autonomous starts out the same, but instead of launching balls, we will go
straight to the beacons. Once we are done with the beacons, we back up until we are inline with the
Center Vortex, then we launch two balls.

## _A more in depth look at our Autonomous_

## _**Blue**_

   The robot starts out by turning 26 degrees to the right, than drives forward for 28 inches. Than
   the robot stops, and launches two balls into the center vortex for 30 points. Then the robot moves
   on for 17 inches until it starts looking for the line. Once it has found the line, it will drive
   1.75 inches past the line than it will turn 64 degrees
